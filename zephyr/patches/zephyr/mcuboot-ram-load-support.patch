Subject: [PATCH] mcuboot: add RAM load with revert mode

Add in the ram load with revert mode to MCUboot. This mode allows
MCUboot to load an image into RAM and execute it, while also allowing
the image to be marked for test or permanent boot. If the image is
marked for test, it must confirm itself on the first boot, or it will
be reverted to the previously approved application.
